Ghoster's powerups:

Since im gonna sleep in bout 15 minutes im not sure if I can tell you all the traits so I would like "Cold heart but bound to nature" having the effect: if in a snow biome the wendigo deals four times the damage if in a plains or wood biome he deals two times the damage "cold blooded" the wendigo takes twice the damage from fire

"Living corpse"
A wendigo spawns with 3 rows of hearts since he is undead

"Bone armor"
A wendigo starts with 3 rows of armor

"Inhuman"

Wendigos are fast due to their inhuman structure

"Cannibal"

You only eat meat as a wendigo
